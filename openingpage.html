            This webpage is dedicated to looking at how colon cancer incidence and mortality rates are affected by having health care coverage. This cause is very imporant to me as my Dad died when I was 14 of stage four colon cancer. With not all Americans having health care coverage, it is scary to think about how if you have colon cancer, or really any type of cancer, you may not be able to get the health care you need because you do not have health coverage.
