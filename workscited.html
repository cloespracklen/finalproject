It is reliable because it information directly from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </td>

Therefore, this data set is very valuable and is reliable. The only concern I had was that some of the vlaues for the table essentially ended up being rounded to zero, since the cases were less than 25 according to the subscript on page 10.This was not an ommision of data to me because the incidence/mortality rates for some of the states were so close to zero that they were counted as such by the American Cancer Society, so I opted to leave the data as the source specified it was instead of omitting those parts of the states.  </td></tr></table>
